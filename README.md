# Investigating_Netflix_Movies_and_Guest_Stars_in_The_Office

In this project,supported and guided by Datacamp ,I’ll apply the skills learned in Python to solve a real-world data science problem. 
I’ll discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
